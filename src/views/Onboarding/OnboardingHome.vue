          <span class="c3">“Notice”</span>
          <span class="c2">
            ) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.
            &nbsp;A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 49 Bogart St. #22, Brooklyn, New York
            11206. &nbsp;After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve
            the claim or dispute informally. &nbsp;If you and the Company do not resolve the claim
            or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin
            an arbitration proceeding. &nbsp;The amount of any settlement offer made by any party
            may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the
            amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.

            claim, dispute, or controversy (“Claim”) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
            the relationships among the parties hereto shall be resolved by one arbitrator through
            binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in
            the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) as those Rules
            exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those
            Rules. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment
            upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. This clause
            is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by
            the Federal Arbitration Act. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as
            provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator’s award; any such
            suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a New York state court located
            in New York County, New York. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local
            court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
            interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or
            formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is

            manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration

            shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
            &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant
            any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the
            Rules, and the Terms. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
            decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
